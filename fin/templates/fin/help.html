  			<p>To participate in this study, we are asking you to link your financial accounts to our secure website. This is done through Plaid, a company trusted by millions of consumers to help them manage their spending and saving.</p>
			<p>
				The linking process is simple. After logging in: 
				<ol>
					<li>Click on "Link Account using Plaid"</li>
					<li>Find your financial institution in the list, or search for it using the search box</li>
					<li>Click on your financial institution logo</li>
					<li>Enter your financial institution credentials and click "Submit"</li>
				</ol>
				Repeat steps 1-4 for each of your financial institutions. Once your financial institutions are linked, you will see all your accounts in one place.
			</p>
			<p>For each financial institution you link, you will earn a reward of $10 right now, plus a reward of $5 every month (as long as your financial institution remains linked). The green box on the screen tells you the total monthly rewards you have earned as you link institutions.</p>
			<p>Remember, <strong>UAS will NOT have access to your credentials or any other identifying information.</strong></p>
			<p>Your financial information will be kept secure and protected. Plaid will never share your login IDs, passwords, or any other personal information with UAS researchers or anyone else.</p>
